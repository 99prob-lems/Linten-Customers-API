Of course, let's enhance the README and format it using Markdown for better readability:

# Gatling Maven Project

This project utilizes Gatling, an open-source performance testing tool, in conjunction with Maven, Docker, and OpenJDK.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Docker**: [Download and Install](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Directory Structure

Ensure you navigate to the root directory of the project where the Maven (`pom.xml`) file and Dockerfile are located.

## Docker Build Information

The Dockerfile uses an official Maven image with OpenJDK 17 as the base image. Here's a quick breakdown:

- **Base Image**: Uses `maven:3.8.3-openjdk-17` for building the project.
- **Working Directory**: All operations inside the container are performed within the `/app` directory.
- **Project Compilation**: The project files are copied to the container and built using `mvn clean compile`.
- **Running Tests**: When the container starts, it automatically runs the Gatling tests using the `mvn gatling:test` command.

## How to Build and Run

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t lineten-gatling-maven-plugin-java .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run lineten-gatling-maven-plugin-java
   ```

When you run the container, it will automatically execute the Gatling tests based on the CMD directive in the Dockerfile.

## Test Reports

Once the tests are completed, a detailed report will be generated. You can access this report in the directory:

```
/app/target/gatling/linetencustomers-*.html
```

The report provides a visual breakdown of the performance tests, allowing you to gauge the efficiency, speed, and robustness of the tested services.

This is structured in `.md` (Markdown) format. You can create a `README.md` file in the root of your project directory and copy-paste this content into it. When viewed on platforms like GitHub, the formatting will render appropriately for better readability.
